# breakoutRPG, a Hybrid game using Phaser3
BreakoutRPG is an adventure RPG game where the combat is decided
by playing breakout. Level up and raise your character stats, kill
skeletons and loot awesome weapons, and fight through unique dungeons.

TODO (so far, more will be added):
- Finish map, so it is a smooth experience to walk through, with no collisions.
- Work on the Breakout mechanics:
    come up with combos and maybe a way to preset the way the bricks are layed out.
- Loot and inventory system.
- Pointer support for touch.
