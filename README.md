# Phaser 3 Isometric RPG

This game started out at "A Phaser 3 based isometric role playing game".
After I saw the Game Off 2018 jam on Itch.io I decided to take a break from the RPG 
and added in the breakout scene, and attaching the bricks to actions in the RPG game.

I will probably go back to the RPG now that the Game Off is over. 
If anyone wants to work on it that would be fun. I am just starting
out so I would appreciate the experience.
